# DevBox
# What is DevBox?
* Python Dev helper software for Windows OS. 
* Dev Box is developed by using C# programming languge specifically for the Windows OS.
#
# Why DevBox?
* Instead of writing the codes over and over and opening the terminal think that you can install all the python packages by only typing their names. You can Install, Uninstall, Update PIP, Get PIP and, learn which Python version you are using just with buttons.
#
# How long did it take to develope?
* It took me 1 hour to design the software and 30 minutes to code. I was able to finish the software in 1 hour and 30 minutes.
